## Data Architecture

### Three-Tier Data Model

**1. Global Workouts Library (Shared, Managed by Admins):**

- **GlobalWorkout** (id, name, type, muscleGroups, equipment, searchKeywords, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt)
  - `id`: Unique identifier, URL-safe slug (e.g., "bench-press", "plank")
  - `name`: Display name in Title Case (e.g., "Bench Press", "Plank")
  - `type`: WorkoutType enum ('weight' or 'timer')
  - `muscleGroups`: Array of primary muscle groups (e.g., ["chest", "triceps"])
  - `equipment`: Array of required equipment (e.g., ["barbell", "bench"])
  - `searchKeywords`: Lowercase tokens for autocomplete (e.g., ["bench", "press", "chest"])
  - `isActive`: Boolean flag for soft deletes
  - Managed by admins via web dashboard (currently seeded locally)
  - Synced to all users' local databases

**2. Workout Plan Templates (Shared, Read-Only for Users):**

- **WorkoutPlan** â†’ Week â†’ Day â†’ Workout â†’ SetTemplate
- **Workout** references **GlobalWorkout** via `globalWorkoutId`
- **TimerConfig** (per-workout or global)
- Managed by admins via web dashboard (currently seeded locally)
- Synced to all users' local databases

**Key Workout Identification:**

- Each **Workout** instance has:
  - `id`: Unique per day instance (e.g., "week1_day_1_bench-press")
  - `globalWorkoutId`: References global workout (e.g., "bench-press")
  - `planId`: References workout plan
  - `dayId`: References day
- **WorkoutInstanceId** (generated on-the-fly): planId + weekId + dayId + workoutId
  - Used for progress tracking queries
  - Not stored in database

**3. User Progress (Per-User, Read-Write):**

- **UserProfile** (currentPlanId, settings)
- **CompletedSet** (userId, planId, weekId, dayId, workoutId, setNumber, weight?, reps?, duration?, completedAt, workoutAlternativeId?)
  - Composite tracking: planId + weekId + dayId + workoutId
  - `weight` and `reps`: For weight-based workouts (nullable)
  - `duration`: For timer-based workouts (nullable)
- **WorkoutProgress** (userId, weekId, workoutId, lastCompletedAt, totalSets)
- Stored locally and synced to user-specific Firestore collections (sync not yet implemented)

**4. Workout Alternatives (Per-User):**

- **WorkoutAlternative** (userId, globalWorkoutId, name, createdAt)
- Links to `globalWorkoutId` so alternatives work across all weeks/days
- Example: Create "Dumbbell Press" alternative for "bench-press" (globalWorkoutId), usable in any week

### Firestore Collections

```
/global_workouts/{globalWorkoutId}

/workout_plans/{planId}
  /weeks/{weekId}
    /days/{dayId}
      /workouts/{workoutId}

/users/{userId}
/user_progress/{userId}/completed_sets/{setId}
/user_progress/{userId}/workout_progress/{workoutId}
```

**Key Differences from Local Schema:**

- **Firestore**: Uses normalized subcollections (plan â†’ weeks â†’ days â†’ workouts) for scalability
- **Local DB**: Flattened structure with foreign keys for faster queries
- **Firestore Workouts**: Include template data (`baseWeights`, `targetReps`, `alternativeWorkouts[]`)
- **Firestore Completed Sets**: Use `workoutName` (string) instead of `workoutId` (allows independent tracking of alternatives)
- **User Alternatives**: Only stored locally (not in Firestore templates, which have admin-defined alternatives)

### Local Database (Drift) - Schema v7

**Global Workouts Library:**

- `global_workouts` (id, name, type, muscleGroups, equipment, searchKeywords, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt)
  - `type`: 'weight' or 'timer'
  - `muscleGroups`, `equipment`, `searchKeywords`: JSON arrays stored as TEXT
  - `isActive`: Boolean for soft deletes

**Shared Template Tables:**

- `workout_plans` (id, name, description, totalWeeks, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt)
- `weeks` (id, planId, weekNumber, name, createdAt, updatedAt)
- `days` (id, weekId, dayNumber, name, createdAt, updatedAt)
- `workouts` (id, planId, globalWorkoutId, dayId, name, order, notes, baseWeights, targetReps, restTimerSeconds, workoutDurationSeconds, alternativeWorkouts, createdAt, updatedAt)
  - `id`: Unique per day instance (e.g., "workout-1")
  - `globalWorkoutId`: References global_workouts.id
  - `planId`: References workout_plans.id
  - `baseWeights`: JSON array for progressive overload base (null for timer)
  - `targetReps`: Target reps set by admin per workout (null for timer)
  - `restTimerSeconds`: Rest between sets for weight workouts (null for timer)
  - `workoutDurationSeconds`: Duration for timer workouts (null for weight)
  - `alternativeWorkouts`: JSON array of alternative globalWorkoutIds
- `set_templates` (id, workoutId, setNumber, suggestedReps?, suggestedWeight?, suggestedDuration?)
  - `suggestedDuration`: For timer-based workouts (in seconds)
- `timer_configs` (id, workoutId, durationSeconds, isActive)

**User Progress Tables:**

- `user_profiles` (userId, displayName, email, currentPlanId, currentWeekNumber, currentDayNumber, createdAt, updatedAt, syncLastTemplateSync, syncLastProgressSync)
  - `syncLastTemplateSync`: Timestamp of last template sync from Firestore
  - `syncLastProgressSync`: Timestamp of last progress sync with Firestore
- `completed_sets` (id, userId, planId, weekId, dayId, workoutId, workoutName, setNumber, weight?, reps?, duration?, completedAt, syncedAt, workoutAlternativeId?)
  - Composite tracking: planId + weekId + dayId + workoutId
  - `workoutName`: Actual exercise name performed (for Firestore sync compatibility)
  - `weight`, `reps`: Nullable (for weight workouts)
  - `duration`: Nullable (for timer workouts, in seconds)
  - `syncedAt`: Timestamp when synced to Firestore
- `workout_progress` (userId, weekId, workoutId, lastCompletedAt, totalSets)
  - Primary key: {userId, weekId, workoutId}

**Workout Alternatives Tables:**

- `workout_alternatives` (id, userId, globalWorkoutId, name, createdAt)
  - Links to `globalWorkoutId` for cross-week/cross-day availability
  - User-created alternatives (separate from admin-defined template alternatives)
  - Progress tracked independently per alternative exercise

**Sync Management:**

- `sync_queue` (id, entityType, entityId, operation, data, createdAt, synced)

**Current Data Flow:**

1. App launches â†’ Deletes old database (temporary migration helper)
2. Creates fresh database with schema version 7
3. Seeds global workouts library (22 workouts)
4. Seeds 8 weeks of "Beginner Strength Training" plan
5. User navigates: Plan â†’ Week â†’ Day â†’ Workouts
6. User completes sets â†’ Saves to local database immediately
   - Weight workouts: saves weight + reps, starts 45s rest timer
   - Timer workouts: saves duration, moves to next set immediately
7. Progress persists across app restarts

## Code Style & Conventions

- Use Freezed for immutable data models
- Use Riverpod providers for state management
- Prefer const constructors for widgets
- Use ListView.builder for scrollable lists
- Debounce input fields (300ms)
- Add Riverpod selectors to optimize rebuilds
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Follow Flutter/Dart style guide

## Critical Performance Requirements

1. **Zero Input Lag:**

   - Set entry must be instant (<16ms)
   - Save to local DB immediately
   - Queue sync in background
   - Optimistic UI updates

2. **Efficient Sync:**

   - Separate template sync from progress sync
   - Templates: one-way download (admin â†’ users)
   - Progress: bidirectional (user-specific, conflict resolution: last-write-wins)
   - **Batch Writes**: Buffer up to 20 completed sets before writing to Firestore (~95% cost reduction)
   - Auto-flush batch every 60 seconds or on app pause
   - Exponential backoff retry mechanism
   - Connectivity listener

3. **Data Retention:**

   - Keep only last **2 cycles** of progress data (plan-dependent)
   - Example: 8-week plan â†’ 16 weeks retention; 12-week plan â†’ 24 weeks retention
   - Client-side cleanup runs on each sync
   - Batch delete old sets from local DB and Firestore
   - Keeps storage predictable and costs low

4. **Optimize Rebuilds:**
   - Use Riverpod selectors to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
   - Const constructors where possible
   - Lazy loading for large lists

## Firebase Security Rules

**Global Workouts (read-only for users):**

```javascript
match /global_workouts/{workoutId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth.token.admin == true;
}
```

**Template Collections (read-only for users):**

```javascript
match /workout_plans/{planId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth.token.admin == true;
}
```

**User Progress (user-specific):**

```javascript
match /user_progress/{userId}/{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Flutter
flutter create workout_tracker
flutter run
flutter build apk
flutter build ipa
flutter test

# Firebase
firebase init
firebase deploy
firebase emulators:start

# Code Generation (Freezed, JSON Serialization, Drift)
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Do Not

- Do not expose user progress data across users (strict user-specific access)
- Do not allow mobile users to modify global workout templates
- Do not skip offline-first pattern (always write locally first)
- Do not introduce input lag (no network calls on text input)
- Do not use force push to main/master branch
- Do not commit sensitive files (.env, credentials)

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:**

   - Data model serialization
   - Repository methods
   - Sync logic
   - Timer logic (both rest timer and workout timer)
   - Progressive overload calculations
   - Target: >80% coverage

2. **Integration Tests:**

   - Offline mode (airplane mode simulation)
   - Sync after reconnection
   - Conflict resolution
   - Multi-user scenarios (two users, same plan, separate progress)
   - Weight vs timer workout flows

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Test on Android and iOS devices
   - Offline â†’ online transition
   - Input lag verification (<16ms)
   - Rest timer background functionality
   - Workout timer functionality (start, stop, auto-save)
   - Progressive overload accuracy
   - Alternatives switching

## Deployment

**Mobile App:**

- Sideload only (no app stores initially)
- Android APK signing
- iOS provisioning profiles
- TestFlight for iOS testing

**Admin Dashboard:**

- Firebase Hosting (or Vercel/Netlify)
- Production build optimization
- SSL certificate
- Custom domain (optional)

## Version Control

- Use Git for version control
- Branch format: `feature/description` or `bugfix/description`
- Commit format: Conventional Commits
- No direct commits to main
- Create pull requests for code review

## Progressive Overload Rules

### Weight Progression (Automatic)

Rules for starting weights for sets (grouping every 4 weeks into 1 phase):

- **phase(n+1)week(1)** weight = **phase(n)week(1) + 5**
- **phase(n)week(m)** weight = **phase(n)week(m-1) + 5** (where m > 1)

**Example:**

- Week 1: 10 lbs (base)
- Week 2: 15 lbs (Week 1 + 5)
- Week 3: 20 lbs (Week 2 + 5)
- Week 4: 25 lbs (Week 3 + 5)
- Week 5 (Phase 2): 15 lbs (Week 1 + 5)
- Week 6: 20 lbs (Week 5 + 5)
- etc.

### Rep Targets (Admin-Configured)

- **Target reps are set manually by the admin** when creating the workout template
- Each workout can have different target reps per week (e.g., Week 1: 12 reps, Week 2: 9 reps, Week 3: 6 reps, Week 4: 3 reps)
- No automatic rep progression - fully configurable per workout instance
- Allows admin to design custom periodization schemes

**Note:** Progressive overload only applies to weight-based workouts. Timer-based workouts use fixed duration templates.
